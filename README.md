# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/Bagnall/LCvite
cd LCvite
npm install
npm run dev

## Run app

npm run dev

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Configuring the learning object

There is a config.json file which contains the definitions of all of the components of the learning object and phrases in the languages of your choice, but the instruction texts should be in the language of the target user.

## Customising Jigsaw

The description text should be in the language being learned and should describe the correct.jpg picture sufficiently for the user to pick correct tiles from the pool of correct and incorrect tiles.
