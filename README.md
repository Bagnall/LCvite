# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Configuring the learning object

There is an **index-fr.json** file which lists the various learning object configuration files. It is used to construct a navigation menu.

There are **learningObjectConfigurations/fr/\*.json** files which contains the definitions of all of the components of the learning object and phrases in the languages of your choice, but the instruction texts should be in the language of the target user.
